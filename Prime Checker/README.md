# PRIME CHECKER

This is the program that i made in python as to differentiate between which number is prime or not.It is simple as we have to enter number and it will check wheter the the entered number is prime or not by checking conditions that whether the number is divisible from(2 to n-1) and if number get divisible by one of these number lying between that range then it will not be prime and if it does not get divisible by any of these numbers in range then it will be a pime number.
