# BMI CALCULATOR

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding weight status while taking age into consideration.BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass.Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. 

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

* Under 18.5 they are underweight
* Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
* Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
* Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
* Above 35 they are clinically obese.
